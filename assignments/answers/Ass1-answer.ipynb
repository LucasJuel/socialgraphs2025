    "\n",
    "The problem using random networks, to model real-world networks stems from the lack of outliers within the generated dataset. The book mentions people like President Rosevelt that had 22.000 acquaintances or Facebook users with the max amount of 5000 friends.\n",

    "* Supercritical - ⟨k⟩ > 1\n",

    "#### According to the book, why is it a problem for random networks (in terms of being a model for real-world networks) that the degree-dependent clustering C(k) decreases as a function of k in real-world networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the random network predictions, predict that the clustering coefficient is non-dependent on the amount of degrees a node has but rather the average degree across the whole network. That means that the random network does not take grouping into account where the coefficient is much higher.\n"
